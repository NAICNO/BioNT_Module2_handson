## Objectives

* Demonstrate the use of unsupervised learning for drug sensitivity analysis.
* Example workflow of PCA and K-means clustering with test dataset (drug sensitivity patterns across patients) for patient stratification

## Analysis Plan for Drug Sensitivity Data

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
   * Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, variance)
   * Visualize data distributions
   * Create correlation heatmap

2. PCA Implementation
   * Determine appropriate number of components
   * Apply PCA transformation
   * Calculate explained variance ratios
   * Generate scree plot

3. Visualization of PCA Results
   * Create biplot of first two principal components
   * Plot samples in PC space
   * Generate loadings plot

4. Interpretation and Analysis
   * Analyze principal component loadings
   * Identify drug contributions to each PC
   * Cluster patients in PC space
   * Correlate PC scores with metadata
