## Objectives

* Demonstrate the use of unsupervised learning for drug sensitivity analysis.
* Example workflow of PCA and K-means clustering with test dataset (drug sensitivity patterns across patients) for patient stratification
:::

## Dataset

- Imputed Drug Sensitivities:
  - This data was imputed for TCGA-BRCA patients based on a model trained on cancer cell line gene expression and corresponding in vitro drug response measurements
- Source: [Cancer drug sensitivity prediction from routine histology images](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41698-023-00491-9)

- [Link to download test dataset](test_data/pca_clustering/BRCA_Drug_sensitivity_test_data.csv)*

## Jupyter notebook
- We have made a jupyter notebook with the exercises, learners are expected to download this to their
 computer and open it in jupyter.

## Workflow

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
   * Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, variance)
   * Visualize data distributions
   * Create correlation heatmap

2. PCA Implementation
   * Determine appropriate number of components
   * Apply PCA transformation
   * Calculate explained variance ratios
   * Generate scree plot

3. Visualization of PCA Results
   * Create biplot of first two principal components
   * Plot samples in PC space
   * Generate loadings plot

4. Interpretation and Analysis
   * Analyze principal component loadings
   * Identify drug contributions to each PC

5. Cluster patients in PC space
   * Correlate PC scores with metadata
