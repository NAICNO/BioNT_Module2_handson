## Objectives

* Demonstrate the use of classification for cancer dataset
* Example Logistic regression analysis with Glioma test dataset for Glioma sub-type classification
:::

:::{note}

## ML use-case

* Gliomas - most common primary tumors of the brain
* Glioma categories
  * Low grade gliomas (LGG) - Slower growing gliomas
  * Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) - Most aggressive gliomas type
* Glioma classification (grading) depend on the histological/imaging criteria, but clinical and molecular/mutation factors are also very crucial for accurately diagnose glioma patients.
* Logistic regression based analysis tries to use most frequently mutated 20 genes and 3 clinical features to classify/ grade gliomas

## Dataset

* [Download dataset: TCGA_InfoWithGrade_scaled.csv](test_data/logistic_reg/TCGA_InfoWithGrade_scaled.csv)

* Features:
  * Most frequently mutated 20 genes and
  * 3 clinical features: gender, age at diagnosis, race
* Target variable (i.e, dependant variable or response variables): Glioma grade class information
  * 0 = “LGG”
  * 1 = “GBM”
