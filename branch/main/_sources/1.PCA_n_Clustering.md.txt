## Objectives

* Demonstrate the use of unsupervised learning for drug sensitivity analysis.
* Example workflow of PCA and K-means clustering with test dataset (drug sensitivity patterns across patients) for patient stratification
:::

:::{note}

## ML use-case

* Drug sensitivity scores: 50 drugs and 25 patients
* Unsupervised learning (PCA and clustering) analysis will
  1. Transform the drug sensitivity data (high-dimensional) into a dataset (lower-dimensional) that capture the most significant variance and patterns
  2. Group patients into distinct strata based on similarities in their overall drug sensitivity patterns

:::

## Dataset

* Imputed Drug Sensitivities:
  * This data was imputed for TCGA-BRCA patients based on a model trained on cancer cell line gene expression and corresponding in vitro drug response measurements
* Source: [Cancer drug sensitivity prediction from routine histology images](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41698-023-00491-9)

*[download test dataset](test_data/pca_clustering/BRCA_Drug_sensitivity_test_data.csv)*
