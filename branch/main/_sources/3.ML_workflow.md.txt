# Complete Machine Learning Workflow

## Machine Learning Workflow

:::{prereq}

* BioNT Applied Machine Learning for Biological Data
  * Module 1: Python Numpy and Pandas
  * Module 2: Classification: Logistic regression; Tree-based methods; Matrices for classification evaluation 

*Participants should gain skills introduced in above mentioned Lessons or equivalent skills.*

:::{exercise} Time
2 hours

## Objectives

* Demonstrate the use of complete classification workflow for cancer dataset (expand on previous hands-on session)
* Example workflow of Logistic regression with Glioma test dataset for Glioma sub-type classification
:::

## ML use-case

* ML use-case as described in [Classification hands-on session](2.Logistic_regression.md)
* Example Logistic regression workflow tries to use most frequently mutated 20 genes and 3 clinical features to classify/ grade gliomas
* Demonstrate following key techniques
  * Data exploration and handing missing data
  * Scaling
  * Cross-validation
  * Hyper-parameter tuning with GridSearch
:::

## Dataset

* [Download dataset: TCGA_InfoWithGrade.csv](test_data/logistic_reg/TCGA_InfoWithGrade.csv)


* Dataset as described in [Classification hands-on session](2.Logistic_regression.md)
  * Features:
    * Most frequently mutated 20 genes and
    * 3 clinical features: gender, age at diagnosis, race
  * Target variable (i.e, dependant variable or response variables): Glioma grade class information
    * 0 = “LGG”
    * 1 = “GBM”
* Several Additional columns and rows with null values are spiked into the original dataset for demonstration purpose
